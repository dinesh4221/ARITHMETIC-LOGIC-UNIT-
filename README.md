# 4-BIT ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT
## Overview
Engineered a 4-bit ALU that performs arithmetic and logic operations on two 4-bit binary inputs.

## Features
- Handles operations on 4-bit binary inputs.
- Can include optional carry-in and carry-out.
- Typically implemented using 2â€™s complement for subtraction.
- Controlled by a 2-bit select line.
- Output changes immediately based on input changes.No internal clocking needed (purely combinational logic).
- Can be expanded to 8-bit, 16-bit, etc., using the same design principles.
- Can perform logical operations like Bitwise AND and Bitwise OR.
